# V2-SaveHandler
Two simple python scripts that rename autosaves (autosave.v2 to 1.v2, 2.v2, etc) and output a .csv file with either the Population Data, the GDP or the Culture/Religion of the world.

Credits to Robert Milligan for the original tool and idea

NOTE: A duplicate Localization removal tool and a cleanup (changes tabs to spaces) were also included for future modifications.
